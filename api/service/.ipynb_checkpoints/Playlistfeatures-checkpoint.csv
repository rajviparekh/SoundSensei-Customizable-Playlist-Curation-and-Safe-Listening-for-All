It always ends the same
When it was me and you
But every time I meet somebody new
Its like déjà vu Déjà vu
I swear they sound the same
Its like they know my skin
Every word they say sounds just like him
And it goes like this


Well get in your car and youll lean to kiss me
Well talk for hours and lie on the backseat
Uhhuh uhhuh uh
Uhhuh uhhuh
And then one random night when everything changes
You wont reply and well go back to

Im still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad know you happy
Hate to see you happy if Im not the one drivin


Im so mature Im so mature
Im so mature I got me a therapist to tell me theres other men
I dont want none I just want you
If I cant have you no one should

I might kill my ex not the best idea
His new girlfriends next howd I get here
I might kill my ex I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

 
I get the sense that its a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon be evidence this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you no murders or crime of passion but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmers market with your perfect peach
Now Im in the basement plannin home invasion
Now you layin facedown got me singin over a beat
