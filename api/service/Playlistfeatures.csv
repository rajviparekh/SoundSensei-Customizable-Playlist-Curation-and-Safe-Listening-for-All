still be friends But Ill admit that I was glad it was over But you didnt have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I dont even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough No you didnt have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records and then change your number I guess that I dont need that though Now youre just Now youre just Now youre just You might also like Break Kimbra Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believing it was always something that Id done But I dont wanna live
